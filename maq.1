.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Maq is a software that builds mapping assemblies from short reads
generated by the next-generation sequencing machines. It is particularly
designed for Illumina-Solexa 1G Genetic Analyzer, and has a preliminary
functionality to handle \s-1AB\s0 SOLiD data.
.PP
With Maq you can:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fast align Illumina/SOLiD reads to the reference genome. With the
default options, one million pairs of reads can be mapped to the human
genome in about 10 \s-1CPU\s0 hours with less than 1G memory.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Accurately measure the error probability of the alignment of each
individual read.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Call the consensus genotypes, including homozygous and heterozygous
polymorphisms, with a Phred probabilistic quality assigned to each base.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Find short indels with paired end reads.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Accurately find large scale genomic deletions and translocations with
paired end reads.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Discover potential CNVs by checking read depth.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Evaluate the accuracy of raw base qualities from sequencers and help to
check the systematic errors.
.PP
However, Maq can \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Do \fIde novo\fR assembly. (Maq can only call the consensus by mapping
reads to a known reference.)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Map shorts reads against themselves. (Maq can only find complete overlap
between reads.)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Align capillary reads or 454 reads to the reference. (Maq cannot align
reads longer than 63bp.)

.IP "*" 2
Paired end reads should be prepared in two files, one for each end, with
reads are sorted in the same order. This means the k\-th read in the
first file is mated with the k\-th read in the second file. The
corresponding read names must be identical up to the tailing `/1' or
`/2'. For example, such a pair of read names are allowed:
`\s-1EAS1_1_5_100_200/1\s0' and `\s-1EAS1_1_5_100_200/2\s0'. The tailing `/[12]' is
usually generated by the GAPipeline to distinguish the two ends in a
pair.
.IP "*" 2
The output is a compressed binary file. It is affected by the
endianness.
.IP "*" 2
The best way to run this command is to provide about 1 to 3 million
reads as input. More reads consume more memory.
.IP "*" 2
Option \fB\-n\fR controls the sensitivity of the alignment. By default, a
hit with up to 2 mismatches can be always found. Higher \fB\-n\fR finds more
hits and also improves the accuracy of mapping qualities. However, this
is done at the cost of speed.
.IP "*" 2
Alignments with many high-quality mismatches should be discarded as
false alignments or possible contaminations. This behaviour is
controlled by option \fB\-e\fR. The \fB\-e\fR threshold is only calculated
approximately because base qualities are divided by 10 at a certain
stage of the alignment. The \fB\-Q\fR option in the \fBassemble\fR command
precisely set the threshold.
.IP "*" 2
A pair of reads are said to be correctly paired if and only if the
orientation is \fI\s-1FR\s0\fR and the outer distance of the pair is no larger
than \fImaxins\fR. There is no limit on the minimum insert size. This
setting is determined by the paired end alignment algorithm used in
Maq. Requiring a minimum insert size will lead to some wrong alignments
with highly overestimated mapping qualities.
.IP "*" 2
Currently, read pairs from Illumina/Solexa long-insert library have \s-1RF\s0
read orientation. The maximum insert size is set by option
\&\fB\-A\fR. However, long-insert library is also mixed with a small fraction
of short-insert read pairs. \fB\-a\fR should also be set correctly.
.IP "*" 2
Sometimes 5'\-end or even the entire 3'\-adapter sequence may be
sequenced. Providing \fB\-d\fR renders Maq to eliminate the adapter
contaminations.
.IP "*" 2
Given 2 million reads as input, \fBmaq\fR usually takes 800MB memory.

In theory, this command can merge unlimited number of
alignments. However, as mapmerge will be reading all the inputs at the
same time, it may hit the limit of the maximum number of opening files
set by the \s-1OS\s0. At present, this has to be manually solved by endusers.

Command \fBmapmerge\fR can be used to merge alignment files with different
read lengths. All the subsequent analyses do not assume fixed length any
more.

Remove pairs with identical outer coordinates. In principle, pairs with
identical outer coordinates should happen rarely. However, due to the
amplification in sample preparation, this occurs much more frequently
than by chance. Practical analyses show that removing duplicates helps

Call consistent indels from paired end reads. The output is \s-1TAB\s0
delimited with each line consisting of chromosome, start position, type
of the indel, number of reads across the indel, size of the indel and
inserted/deleted nucleotides (separated by colon), number of indels on
the reverse strand, number of indels on the forward strand, 5' sequence
ahead of the indel, 3' sequence following the indel, number of reads
aligned without indels and three additional columns for filters.
.Sp
At the 3rd column, type of the indel, a star indicates the indel is
confirmed by reads from both strands, a plus means the indel is hit by
at least two reads but from the same strand, a minus shows the indel is
only found on one read, and a dot means the indel is too close to
another indel and is filtered out.

number of reads mapped without indels. For more details, see the `maq.pl

Call potential homozygous indels and break points by detecting the

also \s-1TAB\s0 delimited with each line consisting of chromosome, approximate
coordinate, length of the abnormal region, number of reads mapped across
the position, number of reads on the left-hand side of the position and
number of reads on the right-hand side. The last column can be ignored.

The output contains many false positives. A recommended filter could be:

Note that this command does not aim to be an accurate indel detector,
but mainly helps to avoid some false positives in substitution
calling. In addition, it only works well given deep depth (~40X for
example); otherwise the false negative rate would be very high.

Display the read alignment in plain text. For reads aligned before the
Smith-Waterman alignment, each line consists of read name, chromosome,
position, strand, insert size from the outer coorniates of a pair,
paired flag, mapping quality, single-end mapping quality, alternative
mapping quality, number of mismatches of the best hit, sum of qualities
of mismatched bases of the best hit, number of 0\-mismatch hits of the
first 24bp, number of 1\-mismatch hits of the first 24bp on the
reference, length of the read, read sequence and its quality.
Alternative mapping quality always equals to mapping quality if the
reads are not paired. If reads are paired, it equals to the smaller
mapping quality of the two ends. This alternative mapping quality is
actually the mapping quality of an abnormal pair.
.Sp
The fifth column, paired flag, is a bitwise flag. Its lower 4 bits give
the orientation: 1 stands for \s-1FF\s0, 2 for \s-1FR\s0, 4 for \s-1RF\s0, and 8 for \s-1RR\s0,
where \s-1FR\s0 means that the read with smaller coordinate is on the forward
strand, and its mate is on the reverse strand. Only \s-1FR\s0 is allowed for a
correct pair. The higher bits of this flag give further information. If
the pair meets the paired end requirement, 16 will be set. If the two
reads are mapped to different chromosomes, 32 will be set. If one of the
two reads cannot be mapped at all, 64 will be set. The flag for a
correct pair always equals to 18.
.Sp
For reads aligned by the Smith-Waterman alignment afterwards, the flag
is always 130. A line consists of read name, chromosome, position,
strand, insert size, flag (always 130), position of the indel on the
read (0 if no indel), length of the indels (positive for insertions and
negative for deletions), mapping quality of its mate, number of
mismatches of the best hit, sum of qualities of mismatched bases of the
best hit, two zeros, length of the read, read sequence and its
quality. The mate of a 130\-flagged read always gets a flag 18.
.Sp
Flag 192 indicates that the read is not mapped but its mate is
mapped. For such a read pair, one read has flag 64 and the other has
192.

Read quality check. The mapcheck first reports the composition and the
depth of the reference. After that there is a form. The first column
indicates the position on a read. Following four columns which show the
nucleotide composition, substitution rates between the reference and
reads will be given. These rates and the numbers in the following
columns are scaled to 999 and rounded to nearest integer. The next group
of columns show the distribution of base qualities along the reads at a
quality interval of 10. A decay in quality can usually be observed,
which means bases at the end of read are less accurate. The last group
of columns present the fraction of substitutions for read bases at a
quality interval. This measures the accuracy of base quality
estimation. Idealy, we expect to see 1 in the 3? column, 10 in the 2?
column and 100 in the 1? column.

.Sp
Extract \s-1SNP\s0 sites. Each line consists of chromosome, position, reference
base, consensus base, Phred-like consensus quality, read depth, the
average number of hits of reads covering this position, the highest
mapping quality of the reads covering the position, the minimum
consensus quality in the 3bp flanking regions at each side of the site
(6bp in total), the second best call, log likelihood ratio of the second
best and the third best call, and the third best call.
.Sp
The 5th column is the key criterion when you judge the reliability of a
\&\s-1SNP\s0. However, as this quality is only calculated assuming site
independency, you should also consider other columns to get more
accurate \s-1SNP\s0 calls. Script command `\fBmaq.pl\fR \fBSNPfilter\fR' is designed
for this (see below).
.Sp
The 7th column implies whether the site falls in a repetitive region. If
no read covering the site can be mapped with high mapping quality, the
flanking region is possibly repetitive or in the lack of good
reads. A \s-1SNP\s0 at such site is usually not reliable.
.Sp
The 8th column roughly gives the copy number of the flanking region in
the reference genome. In most cases, this number approaches 1.00, which
means the region is about unique. Sometimes you may see non-zero read
depth but 0.00 at the 7th column. This indicates that all the reads
covering the position have at least two mismatches. Maq only counts the
number of 0\- and 1\-mismatch hits to the reference. This is due to a
complex technical issue.
.Sp
The 9th column gives the neighbouring quality. Filtering on this column
is also required to get reliable SNPs. This idea is inspired by \s-1NQS\s0,
although \s-1NQS\s0 is initially designed for a single read instead of a
consensus.

Correct the number of reads mapped without indels for homopolymer
tracts. This command modify the 4th, 10th and the last three columns of
\&\fIin.indelpe\fR and output the result in \fIout.indelpe\fR. After the
correction, the following \fBawk\fR command gives putative homozygous
indels:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  awk '($3=="*"||$3=="+") && $6+$7>=3 && ($6+$7)/$4>=0.75'
.Ve
.Sp
and the following gives heterozygotes:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  awk '($3=="*"||$3=="+") && $6+$7>=3 && ($6+$7)/$4<0.75'
.Ve
.Sp
Please note that this \fBindelpe\fR command just implements several
heuristic rules. It does not correct for impure homopolymer runs or
di\-nucleotide/triplet repeats. Consequently, the two awk commands only
give approximate hom/het indels.
